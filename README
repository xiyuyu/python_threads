test_threads_using_threads
Node is an inherited class from threading.Thread
Hierarchy is a class which contains a set of Nodes
We use threads to test whether multithreads could 
improve effciency
When sleep is used, the speed is improved signifi-
cantly. However, when computations is dense, the 
speed is even slowed down using threads

test_threads_without_threads
Compare. Used to test the speed without using threads
